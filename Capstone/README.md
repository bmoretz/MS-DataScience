# Capstone

<p>The main objective of the project is to model the price movements and forecasts of energy commodities, including gasoline, heating oil, crude (WTI and Brent) and natural gas. We will be developing a proprietary data source derived from publicly available information published to the primary commodity exchanges. Using this bespoke dataset, our research efforts will be focused on using our domain-knowledge as well as our analytical and quantitative technical capabilities to develop predictive models as they relate to understanding the financial markets for energy commodities.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to not only model and predict the behavior of the commodity’s financial  markets, but to successfully derive active market strategies that are able to consistently generate a profit, at a lower risk premium, than corresponding passively traded investment vehicles that are available to the public investment. If successful, we would have a product that would serve as an attractive alternative to the public passive investment options that currently account for 45% of the US stock market, or about $3.7 trillion dollars.</p>
