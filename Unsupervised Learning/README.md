# Unsupervised Learning

<p>This course introduces data modeling for studies in which there is no clear distinction between explanatory and response variables. The objective may be to explain relationships among many continuous variables in terms of underlying dimensions, latent variables, or factors, as with principal components and factor analysis. The objective may be to find a lower-dimensional representation for multivariate cross-classified data, as with log-linear models. The objective may be to construct a visualization of variables or objects, as with traditional multidimensional scaling and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Or the objective may be to identify groups of variables and/or objects that are similar to one another, as with cluster analysis and biclustering. Students work on research and programming assignments, exploring multivariate data and methods.</p>

<p>This repository is a collection of all homework assignments completed for Northwestern University MSDS program in 'Supervised Learning' (MSDS 411). Each assignment includes a PDF of the analysis conducted, and an R file developed to support the analysis.</p>
