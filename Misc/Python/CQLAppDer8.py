# A contagious and fatal virus has tragically struck the city ofâ€‹ Plaguesville, which has been quarantined until the virus has run its course. The function 
# P(t) gives the number of people who are newly infected t days after the outbreak began. 
#
# Find first and second derivatives P'(t) and P''(t)
# Solve P(t) = 0, P(t) and P''(t) = 0, then complete the table.
# Use the table to describe the details of the Plagesville tragedy.
