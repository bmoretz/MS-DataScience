Program Overview:

The integration of data science and business strategy has created a demand for professionals who can make data-driven decisions that propel their organizations forward. You can build the essential analysis and leadership skills needed for careers in today's data-driven world in Northwesternâ€™s online Master of Science in Data Science program.

MSDS students gain critical skills for succeeding in today's data-intensive world. They learn how to utilize relational and document database systems and analytics software built upon open-source systems such as R, Python, and TensorFlow. They learn how to make trustworthy predictions using traditional statistics and machine learning methods.

Choose a general data science track or one of four specializations: Analytics and Modeling, Artificial Intelligence, Data Engineering, or Analytics Management. The specializations are designed to foster individual career growth based on your professional goals. You can further customize your studies with a wide range of elective courses, including financial and risk analytics, artificial intelligence and deep learning, analytics systems analysis, and information retrieval and real-time analytics. 

For more information, please visit the <a href="https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/">Northwestern Master's in Data Science</a> page. My specialization is in analytics and modeling, a brief overview is provided below.

<h2><a id="specializations"></a>Analytics and Modeling Specialization</h2>

<p>In the world of data science, the analysts and modelers specialize in testing real-world predictions about data. Data analysts and modelers conduct research and take complex factors into account to build predictive models and create forecasts upon which data-driven decisions can be made. With a focus on traditional methods of applied statistics, this specialization prepares data scientists to utilize algorithms for predictive modeling and analytics, developing models for marketing, finance, and other business applications.</p>

<h4>MSDS 410-DL Regression Analysis and Multivariate Methods</h4>

<p>This course develops the foundations of predictive modeling by: introducing the conceptual foundations of regression and multivariate analysis; developing statistical modeling as a process that includes exploratory data analysis, model identification, and model validation; and discussing the difference between the uses of statistical models for statistical inference versus predictive modeling. The high level topics covered in the course include: exploratory data analysis, statistical graphics, linear regression, automated variable selection, principal components analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and cluster analysis.&#160;</p>

<h4>MSDS 411-DL Generalized Linear Models</h4>

<p>This course extends linear ordinary least-squares regression, introducing the concept of the generalized linear model and its use in making predictions. The course reviews traditional linear regression as a special case of generalized linear models, and then continues with logistic regression, Poisson regression, and survival analysis. The course is heavily weighted towards practical application with large data sets containing missing values and outliers. It addresses issues of data preparation, model development, validation, and deployment.</p>
